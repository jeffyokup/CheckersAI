# CheckersAI
Work in progress checkers A.I. Still many bugs.  
KINGM3 is the name of the actual AI code. The rest of the classes are purely to get the game checkers to work. 
Currently the KINGM3 A.I. can only make forced jumps, protect an ally piece if it is in danger, or as a last case make a random move. 

The Startup Class contains the main file, and you will be prompted to enter the AI color.
